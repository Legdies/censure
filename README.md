# Censure test module

Here is a simple and may be inefficient module for censoring any inappropriate word which will be declared in dictionary.txt

### How to use it
1. If you have specific filename for your dictionary, edit filename in line 9.
2. If you newbie in coding change file path in config.ini file.

## TODO
[ ] Rewrite this README.md\
[ x ] Add config for module.py
